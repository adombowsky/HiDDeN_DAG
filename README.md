# HiDDeN
This is the GitHub repository for "Learning DIscrete Bayesian Networks with Hierarchical Dirichlet Shrinkage". In this article, we propose a novel framework for Bayesian inference of discrete Bayesian networks (DBNs), called the Hierarchical Directed Dirichlet Network (HiDDeN). All results can be reproduced using the code in this repository. 

# Layout
All simulation studies and applications are contained in the main folder of the repository. The files ```r``` and ```rcpp``` contain functions written in R and Rcpp. There is some overlap between functions in these two folders, and we add the suffix ``_rcpp``` to Rcpp functions that have an equivalent in the ```r``` folder. The LUCAS and METABRIC datasets are publicly available.
